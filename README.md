# Mod6 Jupyter Notebooks

This repository is a demonstration of using Jupyter notebooks with Git to replace REPL problems in App Academy Open. It currently contains only the classes problems for the Mod6 week 17 inverted classroom.

### How to run these notebooks in your browser:
1. `pip install notebook` to install Jupyter notebooks on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. From within the local respository, run `jupyter notebook` to see the entire folder, or run an individual notebook with `jupyter notebook name_of_notebook.ipynb`. Jupyter will automatically open the notebook(s) in your browser.
4. Run individual cells in a notebook with the `Run` button or with `Shift + Enter`.

### How to run these notebooks in VSCode:
1. Install the `Jupyter` VSCode extension.
2. Open the folder or an invidual `.ipynb` file with VSCode
3. Run cells just as you would in the browser!
