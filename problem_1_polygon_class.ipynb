    "Implement a class called `RegularPolygon` with the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A constructor method that initializes two instance properties: \n",
    "the number of sides for the polygon and the length of each side. \n",
    "If the number of sides is less than 3, raise an `Exception` with the \n",
    "message `\"A polygon must have at least 3 sides.\"` \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A class variable called `type` set to an inital value of `\"Polygon\"` \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An instance method called `identify_polygon` that identifies the type \n",
    "of a polygon based on its number of sides. This method should set the `type` \n",
    "class variable for this instance to the identified type based on the following logic:\n",

    "4. A class method called `polygon_factory` that is a factory function for \n",
    "creating instances of the class. This method should take a list of tuples \n",
    "as an argument, where each tuple contains the (num_sides, length) for each \n",
    "`RegularPolygon` instance to be created. The method should return a list of \n",
    "all the class instances created.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A static method called `get_perimeter` that calculates and returns the \n",
    "perimeter of a polygon. This method should take an instance of the `RegularPolygon`\n",
    "class and return the calculated perimeter. (The perimeter of a regular polygon \n",
    "is the product of the number of sides multiplied by the length of each side.)"
